# Arduino-Color-Sorter

## Project Status: Completed âœ… 

## Description
The shading sorting machine utilizing Arduino is an intriguing and prestigious venture for techies, who might want to consolidate Electronics, Machine building and programming. The shading Sorting Machines is utilized for sorting mostly RGB hues. This shading sorting machine isolates diverse hued questions and characterizes them into individual compartments/glasses. The shading sorting machine is completely mechanized with the assistance of Arduino. This electronic task made up of Arduino UNO alongside Arduino UNO BOB, RGB shading sensor, two servo engines and some plastic channels and tube parts ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/83648311/151264348-05235ecd-0f61-4f81-b987-7edbee766e5e.png)
